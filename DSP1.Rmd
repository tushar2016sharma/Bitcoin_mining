## loading the Dataset
### Just removed last 2 coloums as they doesnt contain any values and printed first 5 rows

```{r}
bitcoin_mining <- read.csv("/Users/kusumsaichowdary/Documents/GitHub/Bitcoin_mining/bitcoin_mining.csv")
BCHAIN_HRATE <- read.csv("/Users/kusumsaichowdary/Documents/GitHub/Bitcoin_mining/BCHAIN-HRATE.csv")
regional_hashrate_global_1 <- read.csv("/Users/kusumsaichowdary/Documents/GitHub/Bitcoin_mining/Regional harshrate global 1.csv")
regional_hashrate_global_2 <- read.csv("/Users/kusumsaichowdary/Documents/GitHub/Bitcoin_mining/Regional harshrate global 2.csv")
regional_hashrate_china <- read.csv("/Users/kusumsaichowdary/Documents/GitHub/Bitcoin_mining/Regional harshrate in China.csv")
regional_hashrate_us <- read.csv("/Users/kusumsaichowdary/Documents/GitHub/Bitcoin_mining/Regional harshrate in US.csv")

bitcoin_mining =subset(bitcoin_mining, select = -c(X, X.1))

head(bitcoin_mining)
```


## Checking the Structure of data

```{r}
str(bitcoin_mining)

```
#### Our Dataset contains 5,372 observations(rows) and 15 variables(columns). The structure of the bitcoin mining dataset reveals information related to power consumption, efficiency, CO2 emissions, and hash rates.


## Summary Statistics
```{r}

summary(bitcoin_mining)
```
#### From the summary Statistics, we can see the distribution and range of each variable, as well as the presence of missing values.

## Data cleaning


```{r}

any(is.na(bitcoin_mining))

bitcoin_mining_cleanedData <- na.omit(bitcoin_mining)

str(bitcoin_mining_cleanedData)
```

#### Cleaned the data by removing rows with missing values, the resulting data frame(clean_data) contains 4,815 observations and 15 columns.



```{r}
any(is.na(BCHAIN_HRATE))
any(is.na(regional_hashrate_global_1))
any(is.na(regional_hashrate_global_2))
any(is.na(regional_hashrate_china))
any(is.na(regional_hashrate_us))


```
#### No misssing values in other csv files

## Data Visualization - Line plots

#### Line plots are particularly useful for visualizing time series data, as they allow us to observe trends, patterns, and fluctuations in the data over a continuous interval or time period.


## Plotting Estimated CO2 emissions over time



```{r}

library(ggplot2)


ggplot(bitcoin_mining_cleanedData, aes(x = as.Date(Date.and.Time), y = Estimated..MtCO2e)) +
  geom_line(color = "red", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Estimated CO2 Emissions Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Estimated CO2 Emissions (MtCO2e)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

#### By this line plot, we can visualize how the estimated CO2 emissions due to Bitcoin mining have evolved over the years. This will help us understand the environmental implications associated with the growth of Bitcoin mining activities.



## Plotting Power Consumption over time



```{r}

library(ggplot2)


ggplot(bitcoin_mining_cleanedData, aes(x = as.Date(Date.and.Time), y = power.GUESS..GW)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Power Consumption Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Power Consumption (GW)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

#### By this line plot, We'll visualize the power.GUESS..GW variable to understand the trend in power consumption related to Bitcoin mining over time.



## Plotting Hash rate over time




```{r}

ggplot(bitcoin_mining_cleanedData, aes(x = as.Date(Date.and.Time), y = Hash.rate.MH.s)) +
  geom_line(color = "green", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Hash Rate Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Hash Rate (MH/s)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```



#### The hash rate is a measure of the processing power of the Bitcoin network. A higher hash rate suggests more miners are participating, which also implies higher energy consumption.

#### We'll visualize the Hash.rate.MH.s variable to see how the hash rate (indicative of Bitcoin mining activity) has evolved over time and this will provide insights into the growth and changes in Bitcoin mining activities.


## Plotting Emission Intensity over time


```{r}

ggplot(bitcoin_mining_cleanedData, aes(x = as.Date(Date.and.Time), y = Emission.intensity..gCO2e.kWh)) +
  geom_line(color = "purple", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Emission Intensity Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Emission Intensity (gCO2e/kWh)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```


#### By this line plot we can observe how the emission intensity related to Bitcoin mining has evolved over time. This will give insights into the environmental efficiency of Bitcoin mining practices over the years.


## Plotting Power Consumption (MAX and MIN) over time


```{r}


ggplot(bitcoin_mining, aes(x = as.Date(Date.and.Time))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = power.MAX..GW, color = "Max Power Consumption"), alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_line(aes(y = power.MIN..GW, color = "Min Power Consumption"), alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Power Consumption (Max and Min) Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Power Consumption (GW)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Max Power Consumption" = "blue", "Min Power Consumption" = "red"))


```



#### This line plot compares the estimated maximum and minimum power consumption trends over time. The blue line represents the maximum power consumption, while the red line represents the minimum power consumption.


## Boxplot to visually inspect outliers

```{r}

library(ggplot2)



# Boxplot to visually inspect outliers
ggplot(bitcoin_mining_cleanedData, aes(y = Hash.rate.MH.s)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot ") +
  theme_minimal()


```
