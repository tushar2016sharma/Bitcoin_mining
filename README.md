## Environmental Impacts of Bitcoin Mining


#### This project was accomplished in two phases as described below:

The first project comprehensively analyzed the environmental consequences 
of Bitcoin mining through data and statistical analysis. 
The study focused on two primary objectives which are referred to as 
SMART (Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant and Timely) questions: 
1) What are the impacts of different variables on the carbon dioxide emission intensity? and
2) How does the Bitcoin mining activity (network hash rate) vary with regional variations?
3) The findings of this study inform policy decisions and industry practices in the cryptocurrency sector,
specifically addressing concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental sustainability.

The second project analyzed the environmental consequences of Bitcoin mining through traditional Machine Learning approaches. 
The focus in this phase was on predictive modeling, essentially the following two objectives: 
1) The prediction of Bitcoin price based on the historical market conditions and other important predictors.
2) Prediction of Carbon Dioxide emission which will provide insights about the carbon footprint of Bitcoin mining.
