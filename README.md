### Environmental Impacts of Bitcoin Mining

```
This project was accomplished in two phases as described below:

The first project comprehensively analyzes the environmental consequences of Bitcoin mining through data and statistical analysis. 
The study focuses on two primary objectives which are referred to as SMART (Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant and Timely) questions: 
1) What are the impacts of different variables on the carbon dioxide emission intensity? and 2) How does the Bitcoin mining activity (network hash rate) vary with regional variations?
2) The findings of this study inform policy decisions and industry practices in the cryptocurrency sector, specifically addressing concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental sustainability.
